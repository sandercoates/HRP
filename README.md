# Healthcare Rostering Problem
This repository contains all code used in Sander Coates and Vegard Pedersen's master's thesis, spring 2019.
A model to solve the healthcare rostering problem (HRP) defined in the thesis has been implemented using Python 3.7. The repository also contains test instance files used to test the model.

To use the model, run `test_script.py` script after having installed `numpy`, `xpress`, `pickle` and `xlrd`. Installation is easily done py `pip install`. A license for the [Xpress](https://pypi.org/project/xpress/) solver used in the model may be required.

You are welcome to explore the model and take it further.
